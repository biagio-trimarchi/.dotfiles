This repository contains my "dot files".

___Never heard of dot files?___ 

Look [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_MpUP6aKiQ](here) for a quick reference.


___Trivia___

Did you know that dot files were never supposed to be there in the first place?
See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_VcmK9PbNU](here).
